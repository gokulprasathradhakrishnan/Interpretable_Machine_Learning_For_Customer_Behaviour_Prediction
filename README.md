# Interpretable Machine Learning for Customer Behaviour Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project develops and evaluates interpretable machine learning models to predict customer behaviour in e-commerce, specifically identifying if a session results in a purchase. By leveraging interpretability evaluation techniques, the project balances model transparency with predictive accuracy.

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- Designed novel interpretability metrics using structural model features.
- Compared performance and transparency across ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KAN, and Bayesian Decision Tree.
- Used metrics like Time to Interpret, Interpretation Correctness, Model Complexity, and Subjective Ratings.
- Built a regression model to score interpretability based on structural characteristics.

## ✅ Results
- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Bayesian Decision Tree achieved high interpretability with acceptable predictive power.
- Random Forest and KAN showed high AUROC scores but were less interpretable.
- KAN required batch training due to data size, with significant training time per batch.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
**Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
**Techniques:** Supervised Learning, Feature Engineering, Interpretability Analysis  
**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub, Matplotlib, Pandas
